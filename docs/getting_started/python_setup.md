# Python Setup Guide

{: .highlight }
> You’ll work with preconfigured Codespaces, Jupyter Notebooks, or Google Colab in this course. No local installation is required. This guide is for anyone who wants a local Python environment.

This guide walks through installing Python on **Windows (via WSL2)** and **macOS** using **uv** (the recommended tool) or **conda** as an alternative. It also explains virtual environments, how to set up VSCode and PyCharm, and how to verify your installation.

## Why Virtual Environments?

When you install a Python package globally, it’s available everywhere on your machine - which sounds convenient, but causes problems the moment two projects need different versions of the same package.

**A concrete example:**

If both point to the same global Python, installing `pandas 2.0` will break the first project. A virtual environment solves this by giving each project its own isolated Python with its own packages.

<div style="margin: 1.5rem 0; text-align: center;">
<img alt="Diagram showing dependency conflict without virtual environments vs isolation with virtual environments" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/venv_illustration.svg" style="max-width: 700px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb; border-radius: 6px;"/>
<p style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #6b7280; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
    Without a virtual environment, two projects can't coexist if they need different package versions.
  </p>
</div>

Think of each virtual environment as a fresh, self-contained container. You can have as many as you need, and deleting one doesn’t affect anything else on your system.

## Choosing a Tool: uv vs conda

Two tools are commonly used to manage Python environments. Here’s how they compare:

|  | **uv** | **conda (Miniforge)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Best for** | Everything, including geospatial | Alternative when conda-only packages are needed |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Slower to resolve |
| **Package source** | PyPI | conda-forge (default) |
| **Environment creation** | `uv venv` | `conda create -n myenv` |

**Recommendation for this course:** Use **uv**. It’s fast, handles geospatial packages like `geopandas`, `shapely`, and `rasterio` without issues, and keeps your workflow simple. conda is a solid alternative if you already know it or need a package that’s only available on conda-forge.

{: .note }
> Both tools are covered in the [Creating Environments](#creating-and-using-environments) section. You only need one.

## Windows Setup (WSL2)

WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) gives you a real Linux environment inside Windows. All Python work for this course should happen inside WSL - not in the Windows Python installer.

### Step 1: Enable WSL2

**Option A - via Windows Settings (recommended for Windows 11)**

1. Open **Settings** → **System** → **Optional features** → **More Windows features**
2. Check both **Windows Subsystem for Linux** and **Virtual Machine Platform**
3. Click **OK** and restart when prompted

{: .note }
> **Screenshot:** Windows Features dialog with “Windows Subsystem for Linux” and “Virtual Machine Platform” both checked

**Option B - via PowerShell (works on Windows 10 build 19041+ and Windows 11)**

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

This installs WSL2 and Ubuntu in one step. Restart when prompted.

{: .warning }
> If you see an error about virtualization, you may need to enable it in your BIOS/UEFI settings. Search for your laptop model + “enable virtualization BIOS.”

### Step 2: Set Up Ubuntu

After restarting, open **Ubuntu** from the Start menu (or search for it). The first launch will ask you to create a Linux username and password - these are separate from your Windows credentials.

{: .note }
> **Screenshot:** Ubuntu terminal first launch, showing username/password prompt

Update the package index before installing anything:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 3: Install Your Python Tool

#### Option A: uv (recommended)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify:

```bash
uv --version
```

#### Option B: conda (Miniforge)

Miniforge is a minimal conda installer that uses the `conda-forge` channel by default. It’s smaller and more open than the full Anaconda distribution.

```bash
# Download the installer
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Run it
bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Follow the prompts, accept the license, and answer **yes** when asked to initialize conda. Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify:

```bash
conda --version
```

## macOS Setup

### Step 1: Install Homebrew (if you don’t have it)

Homebrew is the standard package manager for macOS. Open **Terminal** and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the prompts. On Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3), Homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew` - the installer will tell you to add it to your PATH.

### Step 2: Install Your Python Tool

#### Option A: uv (recommended)

```bash
brew install uv
```

Or using the install script:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Verify:

```bash
uv --version
```

#### Option B: conda (Miniforge)

```bash
brew install miniforge
conda init "$(basename "${SHELL}")"
```

Close and reopen Terminal, then verify:

```bash
conda --version
```

## Creating and Using Environments

### With uv

uv has two modes of use. Use the **project workflow** for anything you’ll share or reproduce - it creates a lock file that pins every dependency exactly. Use the **quick workflow** for ad-hoc scripts or notebooks.

#### Project workflow (recommended)

Initialize a new project in your folder:

```bash
uv init my-project
cd my-project
```

This creates `pyproject.toml` and a `.venv` automatically. Add packages:

```bash
uv add pandas geopandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

`uv add` installs the package, records it in `pyproject.toml`, and updates `uv.lock` - a precise lock file that pins every dependency and sub-dependency. Anyone can recreate your exact environment with:

```bash
uv sync
```

Remove a package (uv also cleans up unused transitive dependencies):

```bash
uv remove some-package
```

Activate the environment to run scripts directly:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS / WSL
```

Your prompt will show `(.venv)` when active. Deactivate with `deactivate`.

{: .note }
> Commit both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` to Git. Anyone who clones your repo can run `uv sync` and get an identical environment.

#### Quick workflow (scripts / notebooks)

If you just want an isolated environment without a full project structure:

```bash
uv venv                       # creates .venv using system Python
uv venv --python 3.11         # pin a specific Python version
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pandas geopandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

Install from an existing file:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

{: .note }
> `uv` resolves and installs packages much faster than pip - a full geospatial stack (`pandas`, `geopandas`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter`) takes a few seconds instead of several minutes.

---

### With conda

**Create an environment** named `cp255` with Python 3.11:

```bash
conda create -n cp255 python=3.11
```

**Activate it:**

```bash
conda activate cp255
```

Your terminal prompt will now show `(cp255)` to indicate which environment is active.

**Install packages:**

```bash
conda install pandas geopandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

**Deactivate when done:**

```bash
conda deactivate
```

**Reproduce an environment** from a file:

```bash
# From a YAML file (conda-style)
conda env create -f environment.yml

# From a requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**List all your environments:**

```bash
conda env list
```

**Remove an environment:**

```bash
conda remove -n cp255 --all
```

## Testing Your Setup

Save this as `test_setup.py` in any folder, activate your environment, and run it:

```python
import platform
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def test_packages():
    data = pd.DataFrame({
        "category": ["A", "B", "C"],
        "values": [10, 20, 30]
    })
    sns.barplot(x="category", y="values", data=data)
    plt.title("Test Plot")
    plt.savefig("test_plot.png")
    print("Plot saved to test_plot.png")

def system_report():
    print(f"OS: {platform.system()} {platform.version()}")
    print(f"Python: {platform.python_version()}")
    print(f"pandas: {pd.__version__}")
    print(f"geopandas: {gpd.__version__}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_packages()
    system_report()
```

Run it:

```bash
python test_setup.py
```

If you see a version printout and `test_plot.png` is created, your environment is working.

## IDE Setup: VSCode and PyCharm

### VSCode with WSL

VSCode has first-class WSL support through the **Remote - WSL** extension. This means you edit files inside Linux but the UI runs on Windows.

**Step 1: Install VSCode on Windows**

Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install. The installer will add `code` to your PATH automatically.

**Step 2: Install the WSL extension**

In VSCode, open the Extensions panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and search for **WSL** (published by Microsoft). Install it.

{: .note }
> **Screenshot:** VSCode Extensions panel with the “WSL” extension (by Microsoft) shown and an Install button

**Step 3: Open a folder from WSL**

In your Ubuntu terminal, navigate to your project folder and run:

```bash
code .
```

VSCode will reopen connected to WSL. You’ll see `WSL: Ubuntu` in the bottom-left status bar.

{: .note }
> **Screenshot:** VSCode with “WSL: Ubuntu” indicator in the bottom-left corner

**Step 4: Select your Python interpreter**

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type **Python: Select Interpreter**
3. Choose the interpreter from your conda or uv environment

For uv (inside your project folder):

```
./.venv/bin/python
```

For conda, the path will look like:

```
~/miniforge3/envs/cp255/bin/python
```

{: .note }
> **Screenshot:** VSCode interpreter picker showing the `.venv` environment selected

**Useful extensions to install:**

- **Python** (Microsoft) - required
- **Jupyter** - for `.ipynb` notebooks
- **Pylance** - type checking and autocomplete

---

### VSCode on macOS

No WSL needed. Open your project folder in Terminal and run `code .` - VSCode opens directly. Then follow Step 4 above to select your interpreter.

---

### PyCharm

PyCharm is a full-featured Python IDE. UC Berkeley students can get the **Professional** edition for free through [JetBrains Education](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

**Connect PyCharm to WSL (Windows)**

1. Open **File** → **Settings** → **Project** → **Python Interpreter**
2. Click the gear icon → **Add Interpreter** → **On WSL**
3. Select your WSL distribution and point to the Python binary in your conda or uv environment

**Connect PyCharm to a uv environment (macOS)**

1. Open **File** → **Settings** → **Project** → **Python Interpreter**
2. Click **Add Interpreter** → **Add Local Interpreter** → **Virtualenv Environment** → **Existing**
3. Navigate to `.venv/bin/python` inside your project folder

{: .note }
> **Screenshot:** PyCharm interpreter settings showing `.venv` environment selected

## Troubleshooting

### `conda: command not found` after installation

The installer needs to update your shell config. Run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc      # WSL / Linux
source ~/.zshrc       # macOS with zsh
```

If that doesn’t help, add conda to your PATH manually:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/miniforge3/bin:$PATH"
```

### `conda activate` does nothing

Run `conda init bash` (or `conda init zsh` on macOS), then restart the terminal.

### `geopandas` import error about missing GDAL/PROJ

This can happen if you’re on an older system. Make sure your environment is active and reinstall:

```bash
uv pip install --upgrade geopandas
```

If the error persists, the issue is likely a missing system library. On WSL/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev
uv pip install geopandas --no-binary :all:
```

### WSL2 can’t connect to the internet

Try restarting the WSL network:

```powershell
# In PowerShell (Windows)
wsl --shutdown
```

Then reopen Ubuntu.

### Package conflicts when using pip inside conda

Always activate your conda environment *before* running pip, and prefer `conda install` when the package is available on conda-forge:

```bash
conda activate cp255
conda install pandas            # preferred
pip install some-other-package  # only when unavailable via conda
```

### Old Python 2.x on macOS

macOS ships with Python 2 in older versions. Check what `python` resolves to:

```bash
which python    # should point to your conda/uv env
python --version
```

If it shows `Python 2.x`, your PATH isn’t set correctly. Using conda or uv and activating your environment will fix this - they put the right `python` first in your PATH.
